# UFO Sightings Web Visualization with JavaScript, D3, and BootStrap

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a webpage on which is displayed a table of UFO sighting data. The user can then input search filters to filter the table based on a specified number of parameters.

## Results
A user can visit the webpage and utilize the 5 search boxes on the left side to filter the table. The 5 search boxes are date, city, state, country, and shape. The page could be used to display UFO sightings that shared similar characteristics. For example, all the sightings of "oval" shaped UFOs could be displayed:

Further, a user could filter the table to see specific dates on which sightings occurred. Sightings may be more frequent on certain dates, and perhaps clustered in certain geographical locations.

Finally, a user could filter by locations (states, city, or country) to hone in on possible geographical clusters of UFO sightings. For example, on New Years Day in 2010 there were quite a few sightings in the state of California.

## Summary
While this webpage and user-filtered table are helpful for UFO enthusiasts, one downside is, besides the search boxes, the webpage is not very interactive. One way to remedy that would be to create an interactive map which would provide a simple and powerful visual of UFO sightings based on geography. Another way to further enhance the webpage would be to gather more UFO sightings data. The dataset is quite small (111 entires), so more data would help build out a more robust story regarding UFO sighting characteristics and their respective frequencies in the dataset. Finally, a way to filter sighting descriptions would be helpful as many of them share qualities that would be beneficial for analysis.
