# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a webpage on which is displayed a table of UFO sighting data. The user can then input search filters to filter the table based on a specified number of parameters.

## Results
A user can visit the webpage and utilize the 5 search boxes on the left side to filter the table. The 5 search boxes are date, city, state, country, and shape. The page could be used to display UFO sightings that shared similar characteristics. For example, all the sightings of "oval" shaped UFOs could be displayed:

Further, a user could filter the table to see specific dates on which sightings occurred. Sightings may be more frequent on certain dates, and perhaps clustered in certain geographical locations.

Finally, a user could filter by locations (states, city, or country) to hone in on possible geographical clusters of UFO sightings. For example, on New Years Day in 2010 there were quite a few sightings in the state of California.
